## Project Overview
This project was the second section of the **NLP specialization with classification and vector spaces** authorized by DeepLearning.AI and offered through Coursera. In this project, I utilized **Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis on tweets**. The goal is to classify the sentiment of a tweet as either positive or negative. This was done as part of an assignment for learning Naive Bayes and its applications in natural language processing.


In this project, I:

- Trained a Naive Bayes model on a sentiment analysis task.
- Tested the model.
- Computeed ratios of positive words to negative words.
- Performed error analysis.
- Predicted the sentiment of my own written tweet.

The approach includes:

1. Processing the data.
2. Training the Naive Bayes model.
3. Testing the model.
4. Filtering words by the ratio of positive to negative counts.
5. Performing error analysis.
6. Predicting sentiment for custom tweets.
