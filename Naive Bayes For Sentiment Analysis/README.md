## Project Overview

In this project, we:
- Train a Naive Bayes model on a sentiment analysis task.
- Test the model.
- Compute ratios of positive words to negative words.
- Perform error analysis.
- Predict the sentiment of our own tweet.

The approach includes:
1. Processing the data.
2. Training the Naive Bayes model.
3. Testing the model.
4. Filtering words by the ratio of positive to negative counts.
5. Performing error analysis.
6. Predicting sentiment for custom tweets.
