# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Classification-and-Vector-Spaces

![NLP 1](assets/img/NLP_1.png)

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialization repository, comprising four comprehensive courses designed to enhance anyone's skills in NLP. In this specialization, I gained hands-on experience in **performing sentiment analysis on tweets using logistic regression and naïve Bayes**, **vector space models to uncover word relationships and apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization**, and **implementing a basic English-to-French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing for approximate k-nearest neighbor search**.
